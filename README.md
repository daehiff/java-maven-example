# Maven Example


A little example Project in order to understand how to refactor an exiting project onto a maven project.

## Getting started

On branch `master` you can see the default CLI-Project, without any dependencies.

On brnach `maven_refactor` you can find a version, where the CLI Project was refactored using maven.
